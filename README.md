## Electron and Create-React-App Starter Template

This is a starter template using the latest create-react-app and electron packages

Please use Yarn; scripts can be modified to use npm though

## How to use:

1. Clone or download the repo
2. From the root of the directory run 'yarn install' in your terminal
3. For development, run 'yarn electron-dev'
